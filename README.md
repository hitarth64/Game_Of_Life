# Game_Of_Life
Conway's [Game of Life, GoL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) implementation using Python

Following are the rules:

* Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by underpopulation.
* Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
* Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
* Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
